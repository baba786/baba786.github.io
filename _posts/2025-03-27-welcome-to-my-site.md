# Welcome to My New Site!

This is my first post on my new GitHub Pages site. I'm excited to share my journey and projects with you.

## Why I Created This Site

I created this site to showcase my work and share my knowledge with others. GitHub Pages makes it incredibly easy to publish content directly from a GitHub repository.

## What to Expect

In the future, I plan to post about:

- Web development projects
- Tutorials and how-to guides
- Tech reviews and opinions
- My learning journey

## Getting Started with GitHub Pages

If you're interested in creating your own GitHub Pages site, it's actually quite simple. Here's a basic overview of the process:

1. Create a new repository named `username.github.io`
2. Add your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings

Or, if you want to use Jekyll like this site does:

1. Create a repository as mentioned above
2. Add a `_config.yml` file with your Jekyll settings
3. Create your content in Markdown
4. Push your changes to GitHub

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
